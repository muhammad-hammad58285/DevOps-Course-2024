# DevOps Course 2024
In this file, I am going to be discussing the things I learned in my DevOps course. It was a fun and exhilarating journey of learning about a new world of possibilities and a new perspective of DevOps and how far it has come.
# Blogs Summaries
## Blog 1 [Optimizing Docker for Edge Computing: A Guide to Efficient Deployments](https://medium.com/@muhammadhammad58285/optimizing-docker-for-edge-computing-a-guide-to-efficient-deployments-bdc2ec06fe3f)


Optimizing Docker for edge computing ensures efficient deployments in resource-constrained environments. Key strategies include using lightweight base images like Alpine Linux to reduce size and dependencies, and leveraging multi-stage builds to separate build and production environments. Resource management with CPU and memory flags, cgroups, and localized data storage reduces latency and bandwidth usage. Microservices architecture minimizes compute power needs by deploying only essential services. Lightweight orchestration tools like K3s and Docker Swarm enhance container management with minimal overhead. By focusing on networking, storage, and resource constraints, these optimizations enable resilient, high-performance Docker applications for edge devices.

# Blog 2  [Building and Managing Scalable Kubernetes Clusters with Infrastructure as Code](https://medium.com/@muhammadhammad58285/building-and-managing-scalable-kubernetes-clusters-with-infrastructure-as-code-1b16362f3182)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) combined with Kubernetes enables efficient management and scaling of containerized applications. IaC automates infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using tools like Terraform and Helm, ensuring consistency and reducing errors. Kubernetes provides a robust platform for orchestrating containers, allowing developers to focus on applications rather than infrastructure. By leveraging IaC, teams can rapidly deploy and scale clusters, automate service deployments, and manage resources effectively. Best practices include version control, automated CI/CD pipelines, modular design, and secure secrets management. This approach enhances agility, reliability, and scalability, driving innovation and operational efficiency in modern containerized environments.

## **Projects**


### InterExplorer: Semantic Search Engine for YouTube Videos
[Link: HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/afaqdean/InterExblorer)

Created a search engine using semantic search to query YouTube videos.
Scraped YouTube for links and transcripts, vectorized text using a BERT sentence transformer, and uploaded the vectors to Pinecone.
Used Pinecone API to search for the 3 most similar video entries based on the query text.
The search engine provides YouTube links embedded with the exact timeframe of the query words.
Dockerized and hosted the solution on Hugging Face.
### **Signature Recognition Model**  
- Developed a **CNN-based model** to identify handwritten signatures, achieving a peak accuracy of **87%** after optimizing data preprocessing and training.  
- Improved scalability of training pipelines on resource-limited systems by optimizing batch sizes and training configurations.  

### **Automating Health Insurance Reminders**  
- Designed and implemented an automation solution that reminded employees to update their health insurance dependents, recognized for its efficiency and innovation during a company-wide competition.
